# abstractcypto
The idea of this simple library is to extract away some of the basics involved in cryptography. It is not meant to be a full fledged library, but rather a simple way to get started with cryptography. It is 100% covered by test and this can be used in production code safely.

## Usage
```go
import (
	"github.com/greenygh0st/abstractcrypto"
)
```

## Testing 
`go test`
